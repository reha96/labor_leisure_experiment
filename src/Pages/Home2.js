                    In this study there are two tasks.
                    The amount of your compensation depends on how long you perform each task.

                    For this task you type sentences taken from Homerâ€™s Iliad in English.
                    Each second you work on this task will be paid as a bonus, fixed at <strong>0.5 cents per second</strong>.
                    Typing faster in this task will not earn you a higher bonus.
                    However, there are minimum quality requirements to get the typing bonus.

                <p className="HomePage_p">
                    To get your typing bonus, you are required to type <strong>at least 1 sentence per minute</strong>.
                    Each sentence you type should also have <strong>at least 70 percent accuracy</strong>.
                    For example, if a sentence contains a total of 10 characters (letters and punctuation marks), you should correctly retype at least 7.

                    The second task is watching popular short videos from TikTok and YouTube.
                    For this task you only decide how long you want to watch the available videos.
                    The study interface will automatically take you to the next videos.
                    You will not able to skip or switch between videos yourself.
                    Each second you spend on this task will earn you <strong>0.25 cents per second</strong>.
                    {/* You will not earn a wage for this task, but the videos are meant to be fun and enjoyable compared to the first task. */}
                    {/* Naturally, the shorter time you allocate for the first task, the longer you can enjoy the videos. */}

                    You can <strong>switch between the two tasks at any moment</strong> using the tabs within the study interface.
                    As you select one tab, your progress in the other will be automatically saved.
                    For example, if you did not finish typing a sentence and decide to watch videos before submitting it, the text you typed will remain when switching back.
